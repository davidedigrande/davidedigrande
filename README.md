### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with a background in Business and Economics, who is also very passionate about sports and movement science.
I like lifting heavy ass weights with a good technique as much as I like writing clean and readable code.
I also practice Slackline, Yoga and Hiking whenever I can.
I'm very intrested in Sociology and Psychology.

On top of that, I have past experiences as a Graphic Designer, I can draw and I can make music with Production softwares!

Yes, I love being "horizontal" and gaining as much experience and knowledge I can, in the widest range of domains possible.

I firmly believe this will make me the smartest person I can be, and ultimately, a better developer :)
